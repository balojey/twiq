### ‚úÖ Implemented Faucet Cooldown

- **Added Cooldown Logic**: Implemented a cooldown mechanism for the faucet to prevent users from requesting SOL too frequently.
- **Used Local Storage**: Stored the timestamp of the last airdrop in local storage to persist the cooldown across sessions.
- **Dynamic Button State**: The airdrop button is now disabled during the cooldown period, and a countdown timer is displayed.
- **User-Friendly Feedback**: Provided toast notifications to inform the user if the cooldown is active.

#### üß† Key Decisions

- **Local Storage for Cooldown**: Chose local storage for its simplicity and effectiveness in persisting the cooldown state on the client-side.
- **Client-Side Validation**: Implemented the cooldown logic entirely on the frontend, which is sufficient for a development-focused feature like a faucet.
- **Clear User Feedback**: Designed the UI to clearly communicate the cooldown state to the user, preventing confusion.

#### üìÅ Files Affected

- `src/components/FaucetCard.tsx`
