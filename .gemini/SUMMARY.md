### ‚úÖ Implemented Wallet Faucet Feature

- **Created `FaucetCard.tsx` Component**: Built a new component to allow users to request test SOL from the devnet.
- **Integrated with Solana/Web3.js**: Used `@solana/web3.js` to connect to the Solana devnet and handle the airdrop request.
- **Added to Sidebar**: Integrated the `FaucetCard` into the main `Sidebar.tsx` for easy access.
- **Real-time Balance Refresh**: The component displays the user's current SOL balance and provides a button to refresh it.
- **User Feedback with Sonner**: Implemented toast notifications using `sonner` to provide feedback on the airdrop process (success, failure, wallet not connected).

#### üß† Key Decisions

- **Component-Based Approach**: Created a dedicated `FaucetCard` component to encapsulate the faucet logic, keeping the sidebar clean.
- **Leveraged Existing Toast System**: Adapted the implementation to use the existing `sonner` toast notification system for a consistent user experience.
- **Direct Solana Integration**: Interacted directly with the Solana JSON-RPC endpoint for airdrops, providing a simple and effective faucet mechanism.

#### üìÅ Files Affected

- `package.json`
- `package-lock.json`
- `src/components/FaucetCard.tsx` (new)
- `src/components/Sidebar.tsx`
- `.gemini/TASKS.md`
