### ‚úÖ Solana Wallet Integration Setup

- **Integrated Solana Wallet Adapter**: Successfully installed all necessary dependencies for Solana wallet connectivity, including `@solana/wallet-adapter-react`, `@solana/wallet-adapter-base`, and several wallet-specific adapters (Phantom, Solflare, Torus).
- **Configured Wallet Providers**: Created a dedicated `WalletContextProvider` to manage the connection and wallet state, wrapping the main application in all required Solana providers.
- **Added Wallet Connect UI**: Replaced the placeholder "Connect Wallet" button in the sidebar with the `WalletMultiButton` from the Solana wallet adapter UI library, providing a functional and user-friendly way to connect multiple wallets.
- **Synced Wallet Address with Supabase**: Implemented a `WalletObserver` component that listens for wallet connection events. When a user connects their wallet, their Solana public key is automatically saved to their user profile in the Supabase `users` table.
- **Updated Auth Context**: Extended the `AuthContext` to include a new `updateUserWallet` function, allowing for seamless updates of the user's wallet address.

#### üß† Key Decisions

- **Dedicated Wallet Context**: Chose to create a `WalletContextProvider` to encapsulate all Solana-related context and keep the main `App.tsx` file clean and organized.
- **Observer Pattern for Wallet Sync**: Opted for a `WalletObserver` component to handle the logic of syncing the wallet address with Supabase. This approach decouples the wallet connection logic from other components and ensures that the user's wallet address is always up-to-date.
- **User-Friendly Wallet Button**: Utilized the `WalletMultiButton` for a consistent and familiar user experience, allowing users to easily connect with their preferred wallet.
